//! Bounded static composition for the selected Event bridge foundation.
//!
//! This module deliberately stops below contact scheduling and wire framing. It

//! it to the mission-bound store, installs exact Carry selectors for local
//! outgoing edges, re-verifies retained routes after restart, and exposes
//! payload-redacting materialization and receive operations.
